# Boids Flocking Readme

This repository contains the code necessary to run a simple Boid's flocking algorithm.

Two additions were made to the base code:
	1. A limit to the speed in which the agents can move
	2. A Bounding box that limits how far the agents can go in the world before being stopped

To view a demonstration of the algorithm there is a video titled BoidsVideo.mp4
